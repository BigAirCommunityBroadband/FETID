======================================
Upgrading to a new version of software
======================================

You may wish to take a backup before you start

# cd /var/git/FETID
# git pull

git will display the files which are changed.
You may want to paste this report to a notepad so you don't loose it before you're done.

I like to diff the files to see what changed
eg

/var/git/FETID/public_html # diff . /var/www/fetid/public_html/ | more

then copy across anything that passes the sanity test

/var/git/FETID/public_html # cp bla.php /var/www/fetid/public_html/bla.php


If there is an update to phplib basically the procedure is the same

# cd /var/git/phplib
# git pull
# cd phplib/inc
# diff . /usr/share/phplib/

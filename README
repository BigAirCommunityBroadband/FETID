Description:

This is a simple to use front end for rancid.  
It is a full feature content management website with permission controls.
Database abstraction is provided by PHP Database Objects (PDO).
So you can use pretty much any database server.
We have tested with MySQL, and expect it will work on PostGreSQL, SQlite3.

There is a public/private key generator that must be used to create keys.
The public key is used by the web site to encrypt all passwords stored
in the database.  Keys last for 10 years, but you can replace the keys
easily but deleting the sql database and re-importing the flat files.

This way the sql database does not have the actual passwords in it.
You can create off-site backups of the sql and you only need to keep the
private keys file seperately.
